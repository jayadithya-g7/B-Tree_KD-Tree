Exited the Program


//Let's check the boundary conditions now
<------------------------------------------>

ENTER YOUR CHOICE:1 [insertion/creation of root node here]
enter values:10 20
Time taken for creation of root node 10,20 is 0.00000013 nanoseconds

ENTER YOUR CHOICE:1 [insert]
enter values:30 40
Time taken for insertion of node  30,40 is 0.000002 nanoseconds

ENTER YOUR CHOICE:2[delete]
enter values:35 46
Time taken for deletion of node 35,46 is 0.000000 nanoseconds

//so we tried deleting a node, that's not even present in the tree, and the operation is handled in 0 nanosecs, so the boundary conditions are efficiently handled in the operation

//perform the traverse operation now

ENTER YOUR CHOICE:3
x:10 y:20
x:30 y:40
Time taken for traversal of tree is 0.000027 nanoseconds

//The boundary conditions are not disturbing the run time of the traversal function
//Therefore boundary conditions are handled
